        "Q1) Explain the key features of python that make it a popular choice for programming?                    \n",
        "A1) Python is one of the most popular programming languages due to several key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Readability and Simplicity**: Python's syntax is clear and concise, which makes it easy for beginners to learn and understand. It emphasizes readability, allowing developers to write clean and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Versatility**: Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used for various applications, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Large Standard Library**: Python comes with a rich standard library that supports a wide range of functionalities like handling regular expressions, file I/O, data serialization, and more, without requiring external packages.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Python is platform-independent, which means that Python code can run on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) without requiring changes to the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Extensive Ecosystem**: Python has a vast array of third-party libraries and frameworks (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Django, TensorFlow) that extend its capabilities, making it suitable for complex tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web development.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Strong Community Support**: Python has a large and active community, providing a wealth of resources, documentation, tutorials, and forums for problem-solving, which helps both new and experienced developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Interpreted Language**: Python is an interpreted language, meaning code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier compared to compiled languages like C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Dynamic Typing**: Python uses dynamic typing, allowing developers to declare variables without explicitly defining their type, which makes writing code faster and more flexible.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Integration Capabilities**: Python integrates well with other languages like C, C++, and Java, and can be embedded into other applications, making it useful in multi-language projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Automation and Scripting**: Python is widely used for automating repetitive tasks, scripting, and building tools to improve workflow efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "These features make Python a top choice for developers across many domains."

        "\n",
        "### Role of Predefined Keywords:\n",
        "- **Defining structure**: Keywords are used to define the structure and flow of a Python program, such as loops, conditional statements, and functions.\n",
        "- **Control flow**: Keywords help in controlling the execution flow of the program, like branching (e.g., `if`, `else`, `elif`), looping (e.g., `for`, `while`), or managing exceptions (e.g., `try`, `except`).\n",
        "- **Defining types**: Keywords are also used to define variable types or values, like `True`, `False`, `None`, and to declare variables within a specific scope.\n",

        "In implicit casting, Python handles type conversion automatically to avoid loss of information. For example, converting an `int` to `float` during an arithmetic operation.\n",

        "\n",
        "A6) Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain code blocks based on conditions, using the following keywords: `if`, `elif`, and `else`. These statements control the flow of the program based on whether a condition evaluates to `True` or `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax of Conditional Statements:\n",
        "1. **`if` statement**: Used to execute a block of code if a condition is `True`.\n",
        "2. **`elif` statement**: Stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions.\n",
        "3. **`else` statement**: Executes a block of code if none of the `if` or `elif` conditions are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if condition:\n",
        "    # code block if condition is True\n",

        "if age >= 18:\n",

        "if age >= 18:\n",

        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "Here, if the condition (`age >= 18`) is `False`, the `else` block will execute, printing \"You are not eligible to vote.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Using `elif` for Multiple Conditions**:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "marks = 85\n",
        "\n",
        "if marks >= 90:\n",

        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"Grade: D\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this case, multiple conditions are checked. The program will print \"Grade: B\" because the condition `marks >= 75` is `True` and none of the previous conditions are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Nesting of Conditional Statements**:\n",
        "You can nest conditional statements inside other conditional statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "num = 10\n",
        "\n",
        "if num > 0:\n",
        "    if num % 2 == 0:\n",

        "        print(\"The number is positive and odd.\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"The number is not positive.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this example, the program first checks if `num` is greater than 0. If `True`, it checks if `num` is even or odd, and prints the corresponding message.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Ternary (One-liner `if`) Statement**:\n",
        "You can use a compact form of conditional statements with a one-liner ternary operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "age = 20\n",
        "message = \"Eligible to vote\" if age >= 18 else \"Not eligible to vote\"\n",
        "print(message)  # Output: Eligible to vote\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### How It Works:\n",
        "1. **`if` statement**: If the condition is `True`, the block of code under it runs.\n",
        "2. **`elif` statement**: If the `if` condition is `False`, but the `elif` condition is `True`, the corresponding block executes.\n",
        "3. **`else` statement**: If none of the above conditions are `True`, the `else` block runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, conditional statements help control the flow of a Python program based on dynamic conditions."
